so, i want you to, write a python code that do :
(currently the code is only for to trade tatasteel , with token : 3499)
1. first should check if current time is in between 9 am and 3:15 pm . then if yes then you must do :
a.   first order should be buying order. Place a buying order and store it in buying_price. Check if its ltp is 0.1 % more than the buying_price (Note while checking the ltp you have to read the ltp from redis). If yes, then place sell order. 

And if the ltp is below 0.2 % of buying_price , then also make a sell order, and flag pnl variable as 0. Also print the result, as if it was profit or loss.

b. if pnl ==0 (means loss and 1 means profit), then change the stock action to other. As , if it was buy then make it sell and vice versa. After this repeat step a.

c. Have a order counter. IF number of order placed by you is more than 20 , then stop the while loop, and print , order reached order_count.

================

okay, i have the code , but i want to add one more request :

1. Have a variable inPossition , which will be true if you already in a position. If you are in a position then just check if you are hitting the target or stop loss. after hitting one of them , just after that take a position. dont take position if you have already taken one

==============


i have following code, modify it according to request :


# Main trading logic
order_count = 0
pnl = 1  # Start with profit state


while order_count < 20:
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now().time()
    if current_time >= datetime.time(9, 0) and current_time <= datetime.time(15, 15):
        if pnl == 1:
            buy_order = place_order('B')
            if buy_order and buy_order.get('stat') == 'Ok':
                buying_price = float(redis_client.hget('stock_data', TOKEN))
                print(f"Bought at {buying_price}")
                order_count += 1
                tar = buying_price * 1.001
                sl = buying_price * 0.998
                while True:
                    ltp = float(redis_client.hget('stock_data', TOKEN))
                    
                    if ltp >= tar:
                        sell_order = place_order('S')
                        if sell_order and sell_order.get('stat') == 'Ok':
                            print(f"Sold at {ltp}, Profit!")
                            pnl = 1
                        break

                    time.sleep(1)  # Check every 5 seconds

                            pnl = 0
                        break
